            <h1>Welcome to HH PersonalTrainer</h1>
            <p>HH personal trainer creates one-on-one fitness programmes for their clients, motivating and guiding them to achieve their goals.</p>
            <p>Nearly everyone recognizes the value and benefits of workforce training. When done properly, training can make workers more efficient -- increasing production, revenue, and profits while decreasing costs, waste, and inefficiencies.</p>
            <p>Creating effective training isn’t easy. Some common problems include creating training that doesn't support a true business goal, or that's intended to solve a problem that training can’t fix, or without first identifying the true purpose of the training, or that includes too much information. Or maybe all of those things.</p>

            <h2>An Effective Training Program</h2>
            <b>A Training Needs Assessment</b>
            <p>Analyze the performance problem to get a better idea of what's causing it and to see if training is really the best solution.</p>

            <b>Establish a Goal</b>
            <p>You might be looking to build muscle, or you may be on the hunt for maximum strength. Your goals might also be related to cardiovascular endurance, weight loss, or a combination of multiple goals.</p>

            <b>A Workout Split</b>
            <p>A workout split is how you decide to break up your program day by day. These splits determine what kinds of exercises you do and when you do them.</p>
            <p>Training frequency is an important variable when you’re designing your workout program. Consider how often you want to work out in a week. Because your muscles need rest to recover, three, four, and five-day splits are the most common.</p>
            <p>If you’re looking to build muscle, you might consider focusing on particular muscle groups each workout.</p>

            <b>Exercises</b>
            <p>The exercises you choose for your program should reflect your primary goals.</p>
